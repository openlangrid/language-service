On the occasion of opening. *$%*. IEICE Global Plaza. *$%*. By  Kenzo Takahashi. *$%*. Dir.,  International Relations, IEICE. *$%*. To All of You,. *$%*. It is  my great honor to deliver the first issue of IEICE Global Plaza to you as the chair  of "Task Force for International Policy and Planning of IEICE", or TFIPP for  short here. IEICE has set up TFIPP with the approval of the council in June  this year. It is under the coordination of IEICE International Affairs  Committee in collaboration with IEICE Strategic Planning Office. *%$*. The  final goal of TFIPP is to establish the expected scheme and roadmap of  globalization and enhance the current global academic activities of IEICE through  bi-lateral closer linkage between general readers, maybe mostly IEICE members  and TFIPP so that you would be happy to be a member of IEICE for your academic  activities. For examples, some of the members might encounter the requirement  of urgent paper publication in dissertation or decision of an international  conference to participate in, and other some of readers might have to find a  chance of new job placement on the occasion of graduation in Japan. TFIPP wishes that you would  be able to find a solution in compliance with your needs, and helps you with  the appropriate information, as well. *%$*. Both publications  are provided to inform you of the most updated topics of IEICE’s world or  regional level academic activities and the other special news covering  employment or proficiency tests and so on. However, since the e-mail based  newsletter has a shortage that it would be delivered to only registered people  with their preceding agreement to using their addresses, the users are  restricted while it can transfer to the readers the information in real time  and provide a circular Q/A corner to encourage communications between you and  TFIPP officers to assist your academic activities. On the other hand, generally  speaking, this magazine is delivered to the members who know Japanese language.  Most of them would be Japanese. Therefore, we would like to request Japanese  readers to inform you of these publications to foreign students, faculties and  engineers staying in Japan  or studying / working in the other countries. *%$*. We are looking forward to your  questions leading to fostering your academic activities through this corner and  communications on e-mail. *%$*. Top. *$%*. Hot Topics (1). *$%*. TFIPP starts with 8 members. *$%*. The  eight members listed in alphabetical order below gathered and set up TFIPP  (IEICE Task Force for International Policy and Planning) to discuss the  expected scheme of IEICE globalization. *%$*.

TFIPP  will try to find the best solutions of globalization so that you would be able  to easily and efficiently promote your academic activities through IEICE. *%$*. Top. *$%*. Hot Topics (2). *$%*. Joint International Conference. *$%*. APCC2008 / COIN2008. *$%*. successfully held in Tokyo. *$%*. IEICE Communications Society. *$%*. The joint international conference of the 14. *$%*. th. *$%*. Asia Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC 2008) and the 7. *$%*. th. *$%*. Conference on Optical Internet (COIN2008) was held with the sponsorship of  IEICE, at the site of the Akihabara Convention Hall, Tokyo during 14-16 in October 2008. Three executive leaders, Dr. Hideo Miyahara (National Institute  of Information and Communications Technology, Japan), Prof. Byeong Gi Lee (Seoul  National University, Korea) and Prof. Keping Long (University  of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China) presented keynote speeches  and impressed the participants with their long term visions for evolving ICT, in  the common Opening Plenary session. The excellent technical programs have been  assembled with the leadership of Technical Program Chairs, Prof. Iwao Sasase  (Keio University) for APCC2008 and Prof. Ken-ichi Sato (Nagoya University)  for COIN2008. As special programs, APCC2008 organized a special panel session addressed  to R&D activities toward new generation networks, COIN2008 organized a  poster session where 12 topics were presented in the field of WDM optical path,  optical switching, 3G cellular networks and fiber optics. *%$*. APCC2008 was organized by  IEICE Communications Society and technically co-sponsored by IEEE  Communications Society, Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS),  and China Institute of Communications (CIC). The  APCC has provided a forum for ICT researchers and engineers over the world,  especially in Asia Pacific region since the first APCC was set up in Osaka, Japan  in 1995, in collaborations of academic institutions of regional countries. The  topics of consecutive APCC s have encouraged researchers and engineers facing  the drastically changing era of ICT world due to the evolving Internet and  mobile communications. *%$*. On the other hand COIN2008 was organized by IEICE  Communications Society as well, and technically co-sponsored by IEEE Laser and  Electro-Optics Society, The Australian Optical Society, Engineers of Australia,  Optical Society of Korea, China Institute of Communications and Photonic  Internet Forum (Japan).  The COIN was set up to bring together them, especially from the viewpoint of  encouraging the research activities in both fields of networking and traffic  engineering as well as physical layer photonic hardware technologies, in 2002. *%$*. In  APCC2008, 203 papers in total except the panel session were presented for 42  sessions and 224 people participated in the conference, while in COIN2008, 86  papers in total except the poster session were presented for 16 sessions and 114  people participated in the conference. Both conferences are based on the common ICT, the participants registered  at one of the two conferences were allowed to waive the fee for another  conference, so that they could efficiently participate in more sessions where  they were interested, and they were encouraged to discuss the evolving ICT for  broadband applications with many other participants and presenters. *%$*. Top. *$%*. Useful  Remarks. *$%*. You know "ELEX"? *%$*. IEICE  Editorial Committee of ELEX. *$%*. Graduate  course students often face the problem of international journal paper  publication before their dissertation. Most of academic institutions over the  world require a long time to examine a potential paper after it was submitted,  so that some of them might not satisfy the paper qualification. However, IEICE  reserves the world class complete referee system based on eminent and leading  people picked out of industry, academia and government and promptly return the  decision to each of authors. Above all, IEICE Electronics Express, briefly  "ELEX" electronically achieves the short time paper examination. *%$*. The ELEX is a world  class all-electronic journal published twice a month by IEICE and edited by  itself. ELEX covers the entire field of advanced electronics.
